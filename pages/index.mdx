# Bethany Fannin

Hello! I am a Frontend Developer and DevOps Engineer.

I give life my all - whether it be hiking up a mountain or analyzing an algorithm, I am a vibrant person who is constantly working on some passion project.

For as long as I can remember, I've found myself driven to explore innovative ways of accessing, organizing, and presenting information through digital technologies. In my personal projects, I cherish tenacity, humility, and the opportunity to use my skills to positively impact others' lives. While collaborating with teams, I bring a strong work ethic and an open mind, ensuring that every voice is heard and valued. In group environments, my top priority is fostering communication that is empathetic, supportive, and transparent.

I have a deep passion for meticulously crafted documentation and instructional templates. Analyzing complex systems and providing clear, descriptive language around them brings me immense satisfaction!

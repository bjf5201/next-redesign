Hello! I'm an expert on Digital Minimalism and founder of The Digital Balance. I spend my time trying to help others learn how to balance the time spent on their screens with living meaningful lives in the physical world.  

- Founder of *Triangle Digital Minimalists* - a club local to the Raleigh-Durham area in North Carolina who meet once a month to discuss how digital minimalism can increase inner fulfillment and personal productivity.
- Active member of <a href=https://www.acm.org/special-interest-groups/sigs/sigchi target="_blank">SIGCHI</a> - the ACM's special interest group on computer-human interaction. SIGCHI is the world's largest organization of professionals and researchers working together to understand how user experience design can transform lives in a positive way.
